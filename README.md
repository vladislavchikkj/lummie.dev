## What is Lummie?

**Lummie** is an AI-powered platform designed to automate the process of software development. Users can describe the application they want to build using natural language, and our platform orchestrates AI models to generate, build, and deliver a complete, ready-to-use codebase.

This repository contains the source code for the Lummie platform.

## Key Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Generation:** Leverages Large Language Models to convert text prompts into high-quality source code.
- **🌐 Full-Stack Scaffolding:** Generates everything you need—from the frontend UI to the backend logic and database schema.
- **🛡️ Secure & Isolated Builds:** All generated code is built and tested in a secure, sandboxed cloud environment.
- **📂 Project Dashboard:** Manage, view, and download all your generated projects from a simple, intuitive interface.

## How It Works

The application generation process is simple yet powerful:

1.  **Prompt:** A user submits a detailed description of their desired application.
2.  **Generate:** Our backend triggers an asynchronous workflow that uses an AI model to write the source code.
3.  **Build:** The generated code is provisioned in a secure cloud sandbox where dependencies are installed and the project is built.
4.  **Download:** Once the build is complete, the user receives a notification and can download the final project archive.
